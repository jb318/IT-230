## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

The requirement for the application was to create a basic windows application that allows the user to see a list of IT courses they can take from a dropdown, click a button to enroll in selected class, and then have that class added to their schedule along with a confirmation message if they are eligable.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

The thing I did best for this application I would say is writing the code so that it both successfully accomplishes its intended functionality while also simplifying it as much as possible.

## Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The biggest change from a Console to a WPF application is the need for a mouse cursor and keypad or mouse click to perform operations which is not something you can utilize with just a console.  Keeping this in mind, I made sure to display different elements in the application away from each other and in appropriate places so that the user can handle each task with ease.

## How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

To debug this application, it was important I did some testing on the application itself by running the debugger and selecting classes in various orders to see if the program was properly handling each request properly.  When developing GUI applications in the future, I can apply the same techniques and strategies so that I can see if the application is bugged or is working as intended.

## Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

One of the things I needed to do was display a message on the GUI application itself, but to do that I need a label or text box element that I can write to somewhere in the window itself.  There actually wasn't any that came with the project initially so I had to create a new label in the codes html section so that I could call in the MainWindow C# class and concatenate a new string message depending on user registration success.
